The website is built using .NET Core 1.0. It is hosted an Microsoft Azure http://isthisgeekalive.azurewebsites.net/. It can, of course, be hosted somewhere else by anyone with a copy the source code. 

The monitor application is built using .NET Framework 4.5.2 and Windows Presentation Framework (WPF).
